i didnt wanna mess with other stuff esp since our ends arent rlly connected and its hard to keep track of who's doing what but we have an assessment soon so i wanted to make sure i put some of my work in the git


The registration "works" to the extent it takes in all your info and displays it for what was initially testing purposes and now which I think looks nice
All we agreed on for aesthetic was red and black so that's all it has so far. tested some stuff but it was all ugly
not sure where i'd connect the data collected to.
